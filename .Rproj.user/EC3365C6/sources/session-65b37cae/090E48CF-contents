#HAREMS
## Harem density chart and pup loss first date (from consecutive 0s)
## What counts as a harem?? Many locations, should we group some?
## Harem density = number of females/area, so we need area of each harem
## Help with calculating the harem location for each female (where she was seen the most vs. where she lost pup)

#THINGS TO TALK AB w/ MADDIE
# Comparing whether proportional moms = sequential moms
# I filtered moms w/ >0.25 proportion pup loss and only >1 consecutive 0s. 
# This gives 13 total potential cases of pup loss (5 animals are the same between proportional and consecutive)

##NOTES on potential moms from consecutive 2 ONLY
#40870- second 0 was 6 days later, unsure if this counts
#47123- procedure mom, has 2 sets of consecutive 0s with 1s in between. Mostly sure she lost pup
#48244- looks more like adoption, or her pup was an orphan for a while
#49594- just 2 0s very early on, a day post birth. Rest of record has consistent resights with 1 pup
#49965- doesn't count bc it was just one day with double resight
#51555- maybe but looks like only 2 0s and they were reunited
#51983- DEFINITELY, 4 consecutive 0s and she looked like she was not interacting w/ the pup
#53056- DEFINITELY, 5 consecutive 0s and she may have adopted

#NEED TO FIX
#Looked through the loc chart, and consecutive 0s were counted even if between missed resight days
#Also double resight days are skewing consecutive 0s (how should i get rid of double days)
